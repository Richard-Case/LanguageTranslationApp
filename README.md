This is a translation application that I'm building in Python..

I've based the initial structure on a text speech conversion application I built as part of a course I took several years ago, when I first learned Python.

This new version will eventually act as a Japanese-To-English translation application (with the ability to add other languages later) as a way to leverage the skills I'm developing in pursuit of both my BS in Computer Science and in Linguistics.
